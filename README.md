# Time Pilot '84 for [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)
An FPGA implementation of Time Pilot '84 by Ace, ElectronAsh, Enforcer, and Kitrinx

## Features
- Modelling done at the chip level to match PCB behavior and logic as closely as possible
- Keyboard and joystick controls
- CPU09 CPU by John E. Kent with modifications by B. Cuzeau
- T80s CPU by Daniel Wallner with fixes by MikeJ, Sorgelig, and others
- SN76489 sound core by Arnim Laeuger with fixes by Ace and Enforcer
- Fully-tuned audio filters (selectable within the core) including the PCB's switchable low-pass filters

## Installation
Place `*.rbf` into the "_Arcade/cores" folder on your SD card.  Then, place `*.mra` into the "_Arcade" folder and ROM files from MAME into "games/mame".
For authentic audio filtering, place the `filters_audio` folder onto the root of the SD card and select one of the two provided filter presets from within the core.
`TP84 Light LPF` simulates the PCB's audio filtering when volume-matched to the core's volume while `TP84 Heavy LPF` simulates the PCB's audio filtering when set as loud as possible before clipping.

### ****ATTENTION****
ROMs are not included. In order to use this arcade core, you must provide the correct ROMs.

To simplify the process, .mra files are provided in the releases folder that specify the required ROMs along with their checksums.  The ROM's .zip filename refers to the corresponding file in the M.A.M.E. project.

Please refer to https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Arcade-Roms for information on how to setup and use the environment.

Quick reference for folders and file placement:

/_Arcade/<game name>.mra
/_Arcade/cores/<game rbf>.rbf
/games/mame/<mame rom>.zip
/games/hbmame/<hbmame rom>.zip

## Controls
### Keyboard
| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1-Player Start |
| 2 | 2-Player Start |
| 5, 6 | Coin |
| 9 | Service Credit |
| Arrow keys | Movement |
| CTRL | Shot |
| ALT | Missile |

## Known Issues
1) Set 3 is not supported yet (this version uses a different memory map for the primary CPU)
2) Resolution is incorrectly reported as 253x224
